This project is work in progress.
It will be the most overenginerred written in ReasonML.

## why ?

1. I really like the language, and i don't see many examples of fully featured web apps written in so far (25.02.2020), and even they are, more is better.
   So main goal is, maybe when someone will be struggle with problem like 'I know how to do it in JS but what about Reason', he can look into code and figure it out.

2) To show off. To build web app with minimal external dependencies (from frontend perspective).

3) For learning. Web developemnt eco system is extremly big, and when you are starting is big probability that you have know idea how it's working under the hood. Writing my own in reason i hope to learn some cool stuff, that i don't work on daily basis. I will try write frontend part without most of the dependencies which i usually use in my day work.
   Must have dependencies are (that i don't feel like implementing again ðŸ˜…are):

- graphql_ppx_re
- bs-platform
- react
- reason-react
