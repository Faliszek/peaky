This project is work in progress.

For purpose of learning. I really like the language, and I don't see many examples fully featured web apps written with it so far (25.02.2020).

When it comes to learning programming concepts, is best for me to just see the code, and i will figure out it for myself. So in this project i will try cover a lot of things you can do in web app. Graphql, websockets, simple rest call, maybe WebRTC, drawing on screen and lot's of various components. So when you implement your Reason project you just can look here and see how it is solved here (but i don't claim it will be the most correct way ;))
