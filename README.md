This project is work in progress.
It will be the most overenginerred webapp written in ReasonML.

### Why ?

1. I really like the language, and i don't see many examples fully featured web apps written in so far (25.02.2020), and even if they are exist already, the more is better.

- From my experience, when it comes to learning programming concepts, is best for me to just see the code, and i will figure out it for myself. So in this project i will try cover a lot of things you can do in web app. Graphql, websockets, simple rest call, maybe WebRTC, drawing on screen and lot's of various components. So when you implement your Reason project you just can look here and see 'Ou, i can write it that way, it may work for me'

2. For learning. Web developemnt eco system is extremly big and amazing, and when you are starting is big chance that you have know no idea how most of your tools work under the hood (so do I). Writing my own tools in ReasonML probably can teach me a lot of things that i will normally just skip, beacuse they work, so why bother, right? :D

I will try write frontend part without most of the external dependencies which i usually use in my daily work.

    But they are "must have" dependencies for me, that i don't feel like implementing again ðŸ˜…:

         - graphql_ppx_re
         - bs-platform
         - react
         - reason-react
